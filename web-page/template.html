    <p>The consequences of today are determined by the actions of the past. To change your future, alter your decisions today.

        At twenty years of age, the will reigns; at thirty, the wit; and at forty, the judgment.
        Life is like a hot bath. It feels good while youâ€™re in it, but the longer you stay in, the more wrinkled you get.
