            </p>
            <p>Jay Skript has been on the scene since the mid 1990s.
            His talent hasn't always been recognized or fully appreciated,
            In the early days, he was often unfavorably compared to bigger,
            similarly named artists.That's all in the past now.

            Now they're a rock-solid bunch:methodical and dependable.</p>
